# Introduction
Hello, so this bot was made for the support server of [Would You](https://canary.discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=981649513427111957&permissions=274878229504&scope=applications.commands%20bot) where it handles quite literally everything there.
It's currently using the latest version of Discord.js and every command are slash commands to be of convenience. I'm not really looking for people to help with the bot as I'm the sole maintainer and I update it when new features are needed/wanted to be added.

You can use this bot in your own server if you feel as it offers ModMail, Disboard bumping reminder, welcome messages, boost messages, giveaway, and fun for your community server.
